# Thrust: A Web3-Native Discord Alternative

Welcome to Thrust! We're not just building another chat appâ€”we're creating the future of online communities by combining the best of Web3 with the proven success of platforms like Discord. ðŸš€

## Why Discord Succeeded & How Web3 Can Benefit From It

Discord revolutionized how communities interact online by making it easy to create spaces where like-minded individuals can connect, collaborate, and grow. Its success lies in its versatility, user-friendly interface, and the way it empowers communities to organize themselves with roles, channels, and custom permissions.

Now, imagine taking that framework and adding the power of Web3â€”decentralization, transparency, and on-chain interactions. Thatâ€™s where Thrust comes in. By moving roles and points on-chain, we unlock a world of possibilities for communities. Suddenly, your community isnâ€™t just a place to chat; itâ€™s a platform where members can build their on-chain credentials. These credentials can qualify them for exclusive airdrops, provide new monetization strategies, and support the long-term growth of the community.

## The Importance of Integrating DeFi Into a Web3-Native Discord Alternative

DeFi (Decentralized Finance) is at the heart of Web3, and itâ€™s about time our online communities reflected that. Integrating DeFi into Thrust means your community isnâ€™t just a place to hang outâ€”itâ€™s an economy. With on-chain roles, tokens, and rewards, every action in your community can have tangible value. Community leaders can create new revenue streams, members can earn through participation, and the entire ecosystem becomes self-sustaining. ðŸ’¸

Think of it as leveling up your community: youâ€™re no longer just exchanging messagesâ€”youâ€™re exchanging value. This opens up a new world of opportunities for communities to fund themselves, incentivize growth, and reward loyal members. Plus, it aligns perfectly with the ethos of Web3, where value creation and distribution are decentralized.

## Web2 vs. Web3: The Role of Speculators in Community Building

In Web2, ideas are often siloed, and community building can be slow. But Web3 flips that on its head. In Web3, speculators arenâ€™t just bystandersâ€”theyâ€™re integral to the formation and execution of ideas. When an idea is born, it naturally attracts speculators who see potential value. These speculators, in turn, help fuel the growth of the community, bringing in new members, driving engagement, and creating a dynamic environment where innovation thrives.

At Thrust, we recognize this shift. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re creating a unique space where projects, their members, and speculators can all thrive together. Here, ideas arenâ€™t just discussedâ€”theyâ€™re acted upon, traded, and evolved in real-time, creating vibrant ecosystems of innovation and growth. ðŸ’¡

## The Future of Community Interaction: Onchain & On-The-Go

Thrust is built with Web3 at its core, allowing community leaders and members to seamlessly interact onchain. Whether youâ€™re at home or on the go, Thrust is there, enabling you to manage your roles, earn tokens, and engage with your community in ways that were never possible before.

Weâ€™re also introducing the ability to spin out assets in the form of coins, points, and passkeys. These arenâ€™t just digital trinketsâ€”theyâ€™re revenue-generating tools that leverage speculative activity. The better your community, the more opportunities for speculative activities it can attract, driving ongoing revenue and growth. ðŸ“ˆ

In Thrust, communities arenâ€™t just placesâ€”theyâ€™re thriving economies. The integration of Web3 and DeFi means that as your community grows, so does its potential for innovation, engagement, and financial success. So get ready to be part of something bigger. Together, weâ€™re not just building a platformâ€”weâ€™re building the future of digital communities.
