# Powering Your Gaming Community with Thrust: A Web3-Native Discord Alternative

Welcome to the future of gaming communities! Ready to level up your gaming guild or clan? ðŸŽ® Hereâ€™s how you can do it with Thrust, the web3-native Discord alternative designed to empower your gaming community.

## 1. Create Your Hub
Start by creating your own hub on Thrust. This will be the central place where your community gathers to discuss strategies, share game highlights, and coordinate events. [Create your Hub now!](/docs/hubs/creating-hubs)

> **Access Anywhere:** Your hub is available on both web and mobile, so your gaming community can stay connected anytime, anywhereâ€”whether they're on a PC or console.

## 2. Customize with Image Assets
Make your hub uniquely yours by adding some image assets. Upload your clanâ€™s logo, game-related icons, and banners to make your space stand out.

> **Tip:** Customize your hub with game-themed visuals to create an immersive experience for your members.

## 3. Launch Your In-Game Currency
Want to create an in-game currency or token for your gaming community? You can create it on our AMM for under $1! No need for initial liquidity or a market maker. Simply specify your tokenâ€™s image, name, ticker, and how much of the initial supply you want to buy.

ðŸª™ **Pro Tip:** The more players use your currency, the more its value increasesâ€”boosting both engagement and the in-game economy.

> **USD Trading:** Your in-game currency is instantly tradable against a USD stablecoin, giving your community real-world value.

## 4. Real-Time Conversations with Spaces
As soon as your in-game currency is live, a new Space (Thrust's version of a Discord channel) will automatically be created for it. This is where your community can have real-time conversations, coordinate game nights, and share their latest victories.

ðŸ’¬ **Join the conversation:** Keep your community active by engaging in discussions, hosting events, and encouraging your members to share their gaming experiences.

## 5. Instant Swaps with the Swap Menu
Weâ€™ve added a new item to your hubâ€™s navigation called **Swap**. This allows your community members to instantly swap your in-game currency for a USD stablecoin. Itâ€™s fast, easy, and keeps everyone happy.

ðŸ’¸ **Quick Swaps:** No need to leave the hubâ€”everything happens right here, keeping the experience smooth and seamless for your community.

## 6. Easy Onboarding and Funding
All your users need is an email address to get started. They can top up their funds using a credit card or crypto from any network directly inside Thrust.

> **Simple Setup:** Onboard new members quickly and easily, so they can focus on what mattersâ€”gaming!

## 7. Start Airdropping Roles to Your Most Committed Gamers
Directly airdrop roles using our bot while sending a message on the public Space. Reward your top players and keep the competition fierce! [Learn more about roles](/docs/hubs/roles)
