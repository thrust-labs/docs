# Powering Your Memecoin Community with Thrust: A Web3-Native Discord Alternative

Welcome to the future of community building! Ready to take your meme coin to the next level? ðŸš€ Hereâ€™s how you can do it with Thrust, the web3-native Discord alternative designed to empower your community.

## 1. Create Your Hub
Start by creating your own hub on Thrust. This will be the central place where your community gathers to chat, swap coins, and share memes. [Create your Hub now!](/docs/hubs/creating-hubs)

> **Access Anywhere:** Your hub is available on both web and mobile, so your community can stay connected anytime, anywhere.

## 2. Customize with Image Assets
Make your hub uniquely yours by adding some image assets. Upload your logo, icons, and banners to make your space look amazing.

> **Tip:** Eye-catching visuals make your hub more inviting. Donâ€™t skip this step!

## 3. Launch Your Meme Coin
Got a meme coin idea? You can create it on our AMM for under $1! No need for initial liquidity or a market maker. Simply specify your coinâ€™s image, name, ticker, and how much of the initial supply you want to buy.

ðŸª™ **Pro Tip:** The more people buy your coin, the higher the price goesâ€”and so does the liquidity. Watch your coinâ€™s value skyrocket as your community grows!

> **USD Trading:** Your meme coin is instantly tradable against a USD stablecoin, giving your community real-world value.

## 4. Real-Time Conversations with Spaces
As soon as your coin is live, a new Space (Thrust's version of a Discord channel) will automatically be created for it. This is where your community can have real-time conversations, share updates, and of course, drop memes.

ðŸ’¬ **Join the conversation:** Keep your community engaged by being active in your Space. The more you chat, the stronger your community becomes!

## 5. Instant Swaps with the Swap Menu
Finally, weâ€™ve added a new item to your hubâ€™s navigation called **Swap**. This allows your community members to instantly swap your meme coin for a USD stablecoin. Itâ€™s fast, easy, and keeps everyone happy.

ðŸ’¸ **Quick Swaps:** No need to leave the hubâ€”everything happens right here, keeping the experience smooth and seamless for your community.

## 6. Easy Onboarding and Funding
All your users need is an email address to get started. They can top up their funds using a credit card or crypto from any network directly inside Thrust.

> **Simple Setup:** No complicated stepsâ€”just quick and easy access to start building your community.

## 7. Start Airdropping Roles to Your Most Committed Community Members
Directly airdrop roles using our bot while sending a message on the public Space. [Learn more about roles](/docs/hubs/roles)
