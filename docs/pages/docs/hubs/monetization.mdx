# Integrating DeFi into a Web3-Native Discord Alternative: Unlocking New Possibilities

In the world of Web3, the integration of DeFi (Decentralized Finance) into a community platform like Thrust isn't just a feature—it's a game-changer. Thrust allows you to seamlessly monetize your community experiences, making it more than just a place to chat. It’s a dynamic, onchain ecosystem where value creation, trading, and growth are embedded into the fabric of the community.

## Monetizing Your Community on Thrust

One of the standout features of Thrust is the ability for Hub owners to set a treasury address where funds are collected. This gives you full control over the financial aspects of your community, allowing you to manage and allocate resources as you see fit. Whether you’re collecting fees, distributing rewards, or funding community initiatives, the treasury is the central hub for your Hub's financial health.

## Launching Onchain Assets: Points, Coins, and Passkeys

Every Hub on Thrust comes equipped with built-in onchain roles, but that’s just the beginning. You can also launch a variety of onchain assets to enhance your community's experience and drive engagement. These assets include Points, Coins, and Passkeys, each offering unique benefits and opportunities for your members.

### **Points**

Points are the perfect tool for curating and rewarding your community. By issuing Points, you can start building your onchain social graph, where every interaction and contribution is recorded onchain, making it a valuable part of your community’s identity.

- **Soulbound (Non-Transferable)**: Points can be made soulbound, meaning they’re non-transferable and cannot be bought. This makes them incredibly valuable, as they can only be earned through genuine contributions and engagement.
- **Airdrops**: Points can be airdropped by your team or specific roles, ensuring they go to those who truly deserve them.
- **Redeemable for Perks**: Members can redeem their Points for exclusive perks, creating a system of rewards that motivates active participation.

### **Coins**

Coins are a powerful way to bring a financial element into your Hub, enabling members to trade and earn within the community.

- **Fair Launch**: No pre-mining or pre-sale means everyone has an equal opportunity to acquire Coins from the start.
- **Low Cost to Create**: Coins can be launched with no initial liquidity required and for less than $1, making it accessible for any community.
- **Lifetime Trading Fees**: As a community builder, you earn lifetime trading fees, providing a continuous revenue stream as your community grows and trades.

### **Passkeys**

Passkeys are special tokens that unlock exclusive areas and opportunities within your Hub.

- **Fair Launch**: Like Coins, Passkeys are launched with no pre-mining or pre-sale, ensuring a level playing field for all participants.
- **Access to Exclusive Content**: Passkeys grant holders access to the Alpha-Lounge, a private space for premium content and discussions.
- **Priority Access to Sales**: Members with Passkeys get priority access to new sales, making them highly sought after.
- **Lifetime Trading Fees**: Just like with Coins, community builders earn lifetime trading fees from Passkey transactions, ensuring ongoing benefits for your Hub.
