# Spaces: Thrust's Innovative Take on Discord Channels

Welcome to **Spaces**, Thrust's unique alternative to Discord channels. But unlike traditional channels, Spaces are much more than just a place for messaging—they’re a dynamic hub for onchain interaction and community engagement.

## What Makes Spaces Unique?

While Discord channels are primarily focused on conversation, Spaces in Thrust take things to the next level. They provide:

- **Real-Time Messaging**: Keep the conversation flowing with instant messaging, just like in Discord.
- **High-Level Asset Overviews**: Spaces offer an overview of specific asset classes within your Hub, making it easy to see what's trending and who's leading the charge.
- **Leaderboards**: Track top contributors and see who’s making the biggest impact in your community.
- **Onchain Interaction**: Interact with onchain assets directly within Spaces using the Thrust bot, reaction tips, or our swapping interface. It’s seamless, integrated, and always at your fingertips.

## Interacting with Onchain Assets in Spaces

Spaces are designed to make onchain interactions easy and intuitive. Here’s how you can engage with assets directly within your Space:

- **Thrust Bot**: Use commands in your messages to interact with onchain assets. Whether you’re checking balances, initiating trades, or exploring other assets, the Thrust bot is your go-to tool.
- **Reaction Tips**: Show appreciation with a single click! You can airdrop assets directly to other members in the form of a reaction tip. This is more than just a “like”—it’s a tangible reward that recognizes valuable contributions to the community.
- **Swapping Interface**: Seamlessly trade assets within your Space using our built-in swapping interface. It’s quick, efficient, and keeps the community’s economy moving.

### Reactions with Tips: Rewarding Contributions

One of the coolest features of Spaces is the ability to airdrop assets through **reaction tips**. Here’s how it works:

- **Token of Appreciation**: When a member makes a valuable contribution, you can reward them instantly by airdropping an asset as a reaction tip. This not only recognizes their effort but also encourages continued engagement and participation.
- **Simple & Instant**: Just click on the reaction button, choose your asset, and the tip is delivered instantly. It’s a fast, fun, and meaningful way to keep your community vibrant and motivated.
