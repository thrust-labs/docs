# Swaps: Trading Assets on Thrust

The **Swaps** section in Thrust allows for seamless trading of assets directly within your Hub. This feature is available only in Hubs that have tradable assets, such as coins or passes.

## Trading with StellarSwap

In Hubs that support trading, each tradable asset—like coins and passes—comes with its own USD liquidity pool. These pools are automatically created on **StellarSwap**, Thrust's Automated Market Maker (AMM). Here’s how it works:

- **Automated Liquidity Pools**: StellarSwap provides liquidity for your assets, enabling smooth and efficient trades against USD stablecoins.
- **Unified USD Stablecoin**: To make trading straightforward, each blockchain supported by Thrust uses a single USD stablecoin for all trading purposes. This simplifies the trading process, ensuring consistency and ease of use across different chains.

## Trading Assets

With StellarSwap, you can trade your assets against USD stablecoins with ease:

- **Coins**: Trade your Hub’s coins against the USD stablecoin, allowing for flexible transactions and market participation.
- **Passkeys**: Swap passkeys for USD stablecoins, enabling you to access or liquidate these exclusive tokens as needed.
