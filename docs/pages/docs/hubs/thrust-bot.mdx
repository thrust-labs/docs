# Interacting with Onchain Assets in Thrust: A Guide to Using the Thrust Bot

In Thrust, engaging with onchain assets goes beyond simple messaging. Thanks to the **Thrust Bot**, you can directly interact with assets and manage roles within your Hub in a seamless and efficient manner.

## Using the Thrust Bot

The Thrust Bot is your gateway to interacting with onchain assets right from your messages. Here’s what you can do:

- **Transfer Assets**: Easily send assets to other members within your Hub. Whether it's a quick tip or a larger transaction, the Thrust Bot handles it all.
- **Airdrop Assets**: Reward members with airdrops of assets directly through your messages. This feature makes it simple to show appreciation and incentivize participation.
- **Buy Assets**: Purchase assets available in your Hub without leaving the chat. The Thrust Bot integrates with the Hub’s economy, allowing you to make transactions quickly and efficiently.

## Managing Onchain Roles

Role management is an important part of community governance, and Thrust makes it easy for project teams to handle this onchain. Here’s how it works:

- **Granting and Revoking Roles**: The Hub project team can assign or remove onchain roles based on members' achievements. This ensures that roles are awarded fairly and in recognition of valuable contributions.
- **Role Hierarchy Rules**: Similar to Discord, users can only grant or revoke roles that are of lower hierarchy than the highest role they hold. This prevents role abuse and maintains a structured and organized community.
