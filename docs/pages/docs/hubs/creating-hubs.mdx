# How to Create Your Own Hub on Thrust

Ready to start your own community on Thrust? It's easy! Follow these simple steps to create your Hub and begin building your onchain community.

## Step 1: Click the **+** Button

In the left sidebar of your Thrust dashboard, you'll see a **+** button. Click it to start the process of creating your Hub. This is your first step toward establishing a space for your community to thrive onchain.

## Step 2: Choose a Template

Next, you'll be prompted to choose a template for your Hub. We offer several templates designed to fit different types of communities, whether you're focused on gaming, education, trading, or something entirely unique. Select the template that best suits your vision for your community.

## Step 3: Specify Your Hub's Details

Now it's time to personalize your Hub:

- **Name**: Choose a name that reflects your community's identity.
- **Handle**: This is your Hub's unique identifier, so make it memorable.
- **Description**: Write a brief description that tells potential members what your Hub is all about.

These details will help attract the right people to your community and set the tone for what they can expect inside.

## Step 4: Set Privacy Options (Optional)

If you want to keep your Hub exclusive, you can mark it as **'Invite Only'**. This option makes your Hub private, meaning it won’t be available to join even directly onchain. The only way for new members to join will be through an invite link, which you can generate and manage in your Hub's back office.

Once you’ve completed these steps, your Hub will be live and ready to welcome members. Start inviting people, customizing your Hub, and building a vibrant onchain community today!
