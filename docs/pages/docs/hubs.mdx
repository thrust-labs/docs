# Welcome to Thrust: Mastering the Next Evolution of Online Communities

This section is your ultimate guide to mastering Thrust, the Web3-native platform designed to empower communities in the decentralized world. Whether you're just getting started or looking to dive deep into advanced features, we've got you covered.

## What Are Hubs?

Hubs are the beating heart of Thrust, serving as our Web3-native alternative to Discord servers. But Hubs aren’t just about messaging—they’re about creating thriving, self-sustaining communities on the blockchain.

### Key Features of Hubs:

- **Onchain Living:** Every Hub exists onchain, ensuring transparency, security, and true ownership for community leaders and members alike. Your Hub isn’t just a place to chat—it’s a decentralized community with real value.
- **Real-Time Messaging & Notifications:** Stay connected with your community through instant messaging and push notifications, keeping everyone in the loop and engaged, whether they’re at home or on the go.
- **Seamless Blockchain Integration:** With built-in blockchain integration, Hubs allow you to easily manage and trade assets, including stablecoins, directly within the platform. This makes it easier than ever to onboard new members, no matter where they are in the world.
- **No Tech Team Required:** Thrust is designed to be user-friendly, allowing any team to run their Hubs and onchain assets without needing a dedicated tech team. From asset creation to community management, everything is streamlined and accessible to non-technical users.

## Unlocking Monetization: Splitting Protocol Fees

One of the most exciting features of Thrust Hubs is the potential for monetization. Unlike traditional platforms where the company takes the lion’s share of any revenue generated, Thrust is built on the principle of equitable value distribution. Here’s how it works:

### **Protocol Fees Split Equally**

When your community engages in transactions—whether it’s trading tokens, buying assets, or participating in other economic activities within the Hub—a small protocol fee is applied. But instead of that fee going entirely to the platform, Thrust splits it equally between the protocol and the community.

- **Community Revenue:** A portion of the protocol fee goes directly back into the Hub, providing a continuous stream of revenue that can be reinvested into the community. This could be used for things like funding community events, rewarding active members, or even launching new projects.
- **Incentivizing Growth:** As your community grows and becomes more active, the potential for revenue increases. This creates a positive feedback loop—more activity leads to more revenue, which can be used to further enhance the Hub, attracting even more members.
- **Empowering Creators:** Community leaders and creators are directly rewarded for the value they bring to the platform. This aligns with the ethos of Web3, where value creation is decentralized and shared among those who contribute to the ecosystem.

### **Creating Sustainable Communities**

The ability to monetize through protocol fees means that communities on Thrust aren’t just relying on donations or external funding to sustain themselves. Instead, they can generate ongoing revenue through the natural activities of their members, creating a sustainable model for growth and innovation.

In Thrust, your Hub is more than just a chatroom—it’s a living, breathing economy. By empowering communities to earn and grow together, we’re redefining what it means to build and sustain a thriving online community in the Web3 era.
