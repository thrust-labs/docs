# Mastering Widget Context in Thrust Network

## Harnessing the Power of Context for State Management

In the Thrust Network widget ecosystem, understanding and effectively utilizing Widget Context is key to creating dynamic and responsive applications.

### Dynamic Context Utilization

- **Versatile Context Sources**: Widget Context can incorporate data from various sources, including API calls, GraphQL queries, or direct interactions with Smart Contracts across different blockchain networks.
- **Hierarchical Access**: Context established in a widget is accessible to all its child widgets, enabling them to render data dynamically. Parent widgets can access and update their own context, but not that of their children or unrelated widgets.

### Stateless Widgets and Static Properties

- **Configuration File Injection**: Stateless widgets can utilize static properties defined in their configuration file, adding flexibility to widget design without maintaining state.
- **Interacting with Parent Context**: Despite being stateless, these widgets can still access and modify the context of their parent components, allowing for interactive and responsive designs within the widget hierarchy.

This section guides you through the intricacies of managing Widget Context, ensuring your widgets are not only functional but also seamlessly integrated and responsive to user interactions.
