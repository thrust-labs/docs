# Exploring the Possibilities with Widgets

## A Spectrum of Functionalities

Widgets on Thrust Network offer a vast range of possibilities, allowing hub owners to tailor their digital space with various functionalities. Here are some examples to spark your creativity:

### Diverse and Engaging Widgets

- **Leaderboards**: Showcase competitive standings, player rankings, or other metrics in an engaging, real-time leaderboard widget.
- **Online Store**: Create a widget that acts as a store, displaying items from your backend API or smart contract. This setup allows users to browse and purchase items directly within your hub or be redirected to your website for transactions.
- **Game Guides**: Offer valuable information through game guide widgets, providing players with tips, strategies, or walkthroughs to enhance their gaming experience.
- **User Inventory Display**: Develop a widget to render user-specific items from the gaming database, offering a personalized view of their in-game assets or achievements.
- **Exclusive NFT Histories**: Design widgets that present detailed histories of specific NFTs, especially those not available through public sources, adding a layer of exclusivity and depth to the user experience.
- **Activity Feeds**: Implement widgets that pull activity feeds from on-chain data or backend systems, keeping users informed about the latest transactions, events, or interactions within the hub.

### Unleashing Creativity and Utility

These examples represent just a fraction of what's possible with Thrust Network's widget system. The platform opens up a world where functionality meets creativity, empowering you to build widgets that resonate with your audience and enrich their experience in your digital space.
