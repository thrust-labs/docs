# Building Applications with Widgets on Thrust Network

## Versatile and Powerful Widgets

Thrust Network introduces an innovative way to enhance your hub or backoffice through the use of widgets, versatile visual containers that bring added functionality and interactivity to your digital space.

### Flexible and Dynamic Design

- **Stateless and Context-Aware**: Widgets can be either stateless or context-aware, drawing context from backend APIs, GraphQL, or smart contracts to deliver relevant and dynamic content.

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Widgets can contain child widgets, with context seamlessly shared across this hierarchy. This structure allows for complex, nested designs and functionalities.

### Interactive and Context-Responsive

- **State Management**: Widgets and their children can interactively update the context or state, making for a dynamic and responsive user experience.

- **Access Gating**: Customize widget visibility based on user attributes, such as holding a specific NFT, having certain roles, or connected social media accounts, like Twitter.

### Endless Possibilities

- **Examples of Use**: Imagine creating a leaderboard widget that connects to external data sources, or a widget facilitating bridges and token purchases through on-chain protocols.
