# Implementing Access Gating in Widgets

## Tailoring Widget Access with Precision

In the Thrust Network, widgets can be gated, allowing creators to set specific access rules, thereby tailoring user experiences based on certain criteria.

### Flexible and Dynamic Access Control

- **Rule-Based Gating**: Access to widgets can be restricted based on rules that draw from conditions within Thrust Network, external APIs, or blockchain data.
- **Targeted Accessibility**: Creators can limit widget functionality or access to users who meet specific conditions, such as owning particular roles, NFTs, or tokens.

### Enhancing User Engagement

Access gating in widgets allows for the creation of exclusive experiences and adds an extra layer of engagement and personalization to your hub.

This feature exemplifies the flexibility and power of Thrust Network's widget system, enabling creators to design a unique and tailored digital environment.
