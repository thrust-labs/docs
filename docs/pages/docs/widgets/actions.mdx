# Interactive Widget Actions on Thrust Network

## Empowering Widgets with User Interactions

Actions are integral to the functionality of widgets on Thrust Network, providing the means for users to interact and achieve specific outcomes.

### Diverse Outcomes through Actions

- **External Calls**: Actions can be designed to call external APIs or Smart Contracts on any blockchain, enabling a wide range of functionalities and interactions.
- **Context Modification**: Before initiating external operations, actions have the capability to update the local Context of the widget. This ensures that the data being used or sent is current and relevant.
- **Integration with Thrust Network Functions**: Beyond external calls, actions can also trigger built-in functions within the Thrust Network. This includes purchasing assets, claiming rewards, and other platform-specific functionalities.

### A Gateway to Enhanced User Experience

Widget actions are more than just functional components; they are the gateways through which users engage deeply with the widgetâ€™s capabilities, enhancing their overall experience on the Thrust Network.
