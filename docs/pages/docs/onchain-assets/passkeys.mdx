# Passkeys: Unlocking Exclusive Features with Fair Launch and Seamless Trading

**Passkeys** on Thrust are innovative onchain assets built on the ERC6909 standard. They offer a unique way to access exclusive features within your Hub and the broader Thrust ecosystem. Here’s how Passkeys work and how they can benefit your community.

## What Are Passkeys?

Passkeys are price-variable passes that provide access to highly exclusive features within Thrust Hubs and onchain interactions. Built on the ERC6909 standard, they offer:

- **Exclusive Access**: Unlock premium content and special areas within your Hub, such as the Alpha Lounge or other restricted spaces.
- **Variable Pricing**: Passkeys are priced dynamically, reflecting their demand and availability.

## Fair Launch Model: Equal Opportunity for All

Our approach to Passkeys ensures that everyone has a fair chance to participate:

- **No Private Sales or Team Allocations**: There are no pre-sales or exclusive allocations. The first Passkeys are available for purchase at a price well below a cent.
- **Priority for Hub Owners**: Hub owners have the first opportunity to purchase Passkeys, but this must be done in the same block when trading opens to ensure a fair and simultaneous launch for all participants.

## Liquidity Management: Automated and Cost-Effective

Managing liquidity for Passkeys is streamlined and efficient:

- **Automated Liquidity Pools**: Thrust automatically creates a liquidity pool for each Passkey on **StellarSwap**, our AMM DEX. This setup is done for less than $1, ensuring cost-effective liquidity management without the need for expensive services.
- **Seamless Trading**: Automated liquidity pools make it easy for users to trade Passkeys, maintaining smooth and reliable market operations.

## Simplified Trading with USD Stablecoin

All trading on Thrust is facilitated using a unified USD stablecoin:

- **Consistent Pairing**: Each Passkey is automatically paired with a USD stablecoin for every supported chain. This uniformity simplifies the trading process for both existing and new members, reducing complexity and enhancing user experience.
- **Ease of Use**: By using a single stablecoin for all transactions, we streamline the swapping process, making it straightforward to trade Passkeys and other assets.

## Monetizing the Hub: Revenue from Trading Activity

Even without pre-allocations or pre-sales, you can still effectively monetize your Hub:

- **Trading Fees**: A 10% fee is applied to each Passkey transaction. Out of this fee, 50% goes to the protocol and 50% to the Hub owner.
- **Community Growth**: The more active and engaged your community, the more speculative trading activity you can attract. Increased trading volumes boost your revenue from trading fees, supporting the growth and sustainability of your Hub.
