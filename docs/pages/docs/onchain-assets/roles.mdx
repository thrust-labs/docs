# Roles: Revolutionizing Community Management with Onchain Precision

In traditional Discord servers, roles are essential for managing access, responsibilities, and recognition within a community. By bringing roles onchain, Thrust enhances and streamlines this management, creating a more transparent and secure system.

## The Power of Onchain Roles

Onchain roles in Thrust solve many challenges associated with managing roles in traditional systems:

- **Enhanced Transparency**: By placing roles onchain, you ensure a clear, immutable record of all role assignments and changes. This transparency fosters trust and accountability within the community.
- **Decentralized Control**: Onchain roles allow for decentralized management of community permissions and responsibilities. This model empowers members and automates processes that were previously manual and opaque.

## Standard Roles in Every Thrust Hub

Each Thrust Hub comes with a set of standard roles to facilitate effective community management:

- **Founder**: The creator of the Hub, holding the highest level of authority.
- **Co-Founder**: A key contributor who plays a significant role in the Hub’s development.
- **Core-Team**: Essential members who help in the strategic direction and daily operations.
- **Admin**: Administrators responsible for overseeing the Hub’s overall functioning.
- **Community-Manager**: Individuals who focus on community engagement and management.
- **Moderator**: Members who help maintain order and manage discussions.
- **OG (Original Gangster)**: Long-standing members with a deep-rooted connection to the community.
- **Maxi**: Highly engaged members who have shown exceptional commitment.
- **Member**: Default role assigned to anyone who joins the Hub, signifying their membership.
- **Everyone**: The minimum role required to be recognized as a member of the Hub.

## Role Management: Granting and Revoking

Managing roles within Thrust is streamlined and secure:

- **Role Assignment**: Users with at least a **Moderator** role can grant and revoke roles. This ensures that only authorized individuals can make changes to role assignments.
- **Hierarchy Rules**: Users can only change roles that are of lower hierarchy than the highest role they own. This maintains the integrity of role management and prevents unauthorized changes.

## Recognizing Contributions

Roles on Thrust are designed to acknowledge and reward valuable community contributions:

- **Custom Roles**: Valuable members can be assigned roles that reflect their specific contributions and achievements within the community.
- **Dynamic Role Creation**: New roles can be added at any time, allowing for flexibility and adaptation as the community grows and evolves.
