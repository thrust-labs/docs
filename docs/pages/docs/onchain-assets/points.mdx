# Points: Curating Communities and Rewarding Engagement

**Points** on Thrust are a powerful tool for community curation and engagement. Designed to enhance interaction and reward contributions, Points offer a unique way to recognize and incentivize members within your Hub.

## The Power of Onchain Points

Onchain Points are ideal for building and nurturing communities due to their ability to:

- **Curate Communities**: Points help in shaping the community’s dynamics by rewarding valuable contributions and encouraging active participation. By tracking and analyzing Points, you can gain insights into your community's behavior and engagement patterns.
- **Understand the Onchain Social Graph**: Points are integral to mapping the onchain social graph of your community. This graph visualizes connections and interactions between members, providing a clear picture of who’s driving engagement and how influence is distributed.

## Soulbound Points: Non-Transferable and Valuable

Soulbound Points are a unique feature that sets Thrust apart:

- **Non-Transferable**: Unlike traditional tokens, Soulbound Points cannot be bought or sold. They can only be earned through meaningful contributions, making them a true reflection of a member’s involvement and impact.
- **Exchange for Perks**: Members can redeem Soulbound Points for exclusive perks within the Hub. This system ensures that rewards are tied directly to engagement, motivating members to contribute actively.

## Tradable Points: Flexibility and Engagement

If you wish to introduce a more flexible system, you can create **Tradable Points**:

- **Automated Liquidity**: Tradable Points are automatically listed on **StellarSwap**, our AMM DEX. This integration ensures that Points are easily accessible for trading, enhancing their utility and liquidity.
- **Increased Flexibility**: Unlike Soulbound Points, Tradable Points can be bought, sold, and exchanged, providing additional options for members to interact with the community’s economy.

## Airdropping Points: Encouraging Participation

Airdropping Points is a fantastic way to recognize and reward contributions:

- **Team and Role-Based Airdrops**: Points can be airdropped by your team or specific roles within the Hub. This feature allows you to distribute Points strategically and incentivize desired behaviors.
- **Member-Driven Airdrops**: Every member of the Hub can also participate in airdropping Points directly from their specified allowance, even if they don’t own any Points themselves. This democratizes the rewarding process and encourages broader engagement.

Points on Thrust offer a versatile and impactful way to manage and reward community engagement. Whether you use Soulbound Points to highlight valuable contributions or Tradable Points to add flexibility, you’ll enhance your community’s experience and foster a more active and engaged environment.
