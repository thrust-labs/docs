# USD Stablecoin: Simplifying Onchain Trading

Trading onchain should be straightforward and accessible, and one of the key ways to achieve this is through the use of USD stablecoins. At Thrust, we’ve adopted a unique approach to streamline trading by using USD stablecoins as the default currency for all asset transactions.

## Why USD Stablecoins?

The majority of global trades are conducted in US dollars, making USD stablecoins a natural choice for simplifying onchain trading:

- **Universal Acceptance**: USD stablecoins are widely recognized and accepted, providing a familiar and stable reference point for users and traders across different platforms.
- **Consistency**: Using USD stablecoins ensures that all transactions are consistent, reducing confusion and making it easier for users to engage with onchain assets.

## Default Currency for All Assets

On Thrust, every asset is traded against a USD stablecoin by default, ensuring simplicity and uniformity across our platform:

- **Base**: For the Base chain, assets are traded against **USDC** (USD Coin). USDC is a widely-used stablecoin that offers transparency and stability.
- **Polygon**: On the Polygon network, assets are traded against **USDT** (Tether). USDT is a popular stablecoin known for its broad acceptance.
- **BNBChain**: On the BNBChain, assets are also traded against **USDT**, providing consistency with the Polygon network and facilitating easy cross-chain transactions.

## Benefits of a Unified Approach

Our approach to using USD stablecoins brings several benefits to the trading experience:

- **Simplified Swapping**: By standardizing on a single currency, we make it easier for users to swap and trade assets without needing to deal with multiple currencies or conversion rates.
- **Streamlined User Experience**: A consistent stablecoin across all supported chains reduces complexity, making the trading process more intuitive and accessible for both new and experienced users.
- **Enhanced Liquidity**: Using a single stablecoin ensures that liquidity is concentrated, enhancing trading efficiency and reducing spread.
