# Coins: Empowering Communities with Fair Launch and Seamless Trading

**Coins** on Thrust are more than just assets—they’re a cornerstone for building and nurturing communities around shared ideas and philosophies. Here’s a deep dive into how our approach to coins leverages the success of memecoins and promotes a community-first model.

## The Success of Memecoins: Building Communities

Memecoins have demonstrated how communities can form around common ideas and shared philosophies. These tokens often gain traction through grassroots enthusiasm and collective engagement, proving that community spirit can drive substantial success. At Thrust, we embrace this model by focusing on:

- **Community-First Approach**: Our coins are designed to be fairly launched, ensuring that everyone has an equal opportunity to participate. There are no pre-sales, private allocations, or locked tokens—just a transparent and inclusive launch where everyone can buy in at a fraction of a cent.

## Fair Launch Model: Transparency and Inclusivity

We are committed to a fair launch for all our tokens. Here’s how our model stands out:

- **No Private Sales or Team Allocations**: Every participant gets access to the same opportunities from the start. Tokens are available for purchase at a price of less than $0.00001, ensuring that the entry point is accessible to everyone.
- **No Vesting or Locking**: Unlike traditional models that involve vesting periods or locked allocations, our coins are freely tradable from the moment they are launched, promoting a truly open market.

## Liquidity Management: Automated and Cost-Effective

Managing liquidity can be a complex and costly affair, often requiring expensive market-making services. At Thrust, we simplify this process:

- **Automated Liquidity Pools**: For each ERC20 coin, Thrust automatically creates a liquidity pool on **StellarSwap**, our own AMM (Automated Market Maker) DEX. This is done for less than $1, making liquidity management both efficient and cost-effective.
- **Eliminating High Costs**: Traditional methods involve significant fees for paid market makers. With Thrust’s automated approach, we reduce costs and barriers, ensuring that liquidity is maintained seamlessly.

## Simplified Trading with USD Stablecoin

Thrust uses a unified USD stablecoin for all exchanges, streamlining the trading process:

- **Consistent Pairing**: Each coin is automatically paired with a USD stablecoin for every supported chain. This consistency simplifies swapping, making it easier for both existing and new members to trade assets.
- **Ease of Use**: By using a single stablecoin across all transactions, we minimize confusion and make trading more straightforward for everyone involved.

## Monetizing the Hub: Revenue from Trading Activity

Despite the lack of pre-allocations and pre-sales, you can still monetize your Hub effectively:

- **Trading Fees**: Each time a coin is traded, a 10% fee is applied. Of this fee, 50% goes to the protocol and 50% goes to the Hub owner.
- **Community Impact**: The better your community, the more speculative trading activity it can attract. A thriving community drives higher trading volumes, which in turn increases your revenue from trading fees.
