# Revenue Share Program: Rewarding Network Growth and Engagement

At Thrust, we're committed to growing our network with the right members, and we believe that everyone who contributes to this growth should benefit from its success. Our revenue share program is designed to reward those who are instrumental in bootstrapping and expanding our community.

## Invite-Only Growth Model

To ensure that Thrust's network develops with high-quality members, we operate on an invite-only basis. This model allows us to:

- **Curate Membership**: By inviting trusted and engaged individuals, we maintain a strong and dedicated community.
- **Share Success**: Members who contribute to growing the network have a direct stake in Thrust’s success and profitability.

## Revenue Sharing with Invites

Our revenue share program rewards members who invite others to join Thrust:

- **Initial Invite**: Each time a member invites a friend who generates protocol revenue, the inviter receives a 20% share of the revenue generated by the invited person.
- **Extended Network**: If the invited person also invites others who generate revenue, the reward structure becomes 20/40/40. This ensures that the original inviter continues to benefit as their network grows, with the revenue split favoring the initial inviter.

## Hub Creation Rewards

Members who invite others who go on to create their own Hub on Thrust also benefit from the revenue share:

- **Revenue from Hubs**: When a referral creates a Hub, the original inviter earns a share of the revenue generated by that Hub’s protocol fees. This means you can earn from the success of Hubs created by your referrals, further amplifying your potential rewards.

## Decreasing Revenue Share for New Entrants

To incentivize early participation and reward those who contribute to the network's growth during its bootstrapping phase:

- **Decreasing Split**: The revenue share split will gradually decrease for new entrants over time. This adjustment ensures that the early adopters and active contributors receive the most significant benefits, encouraging rapid and high-quality network expansion.

## Maximizing Your Upside

The faster and more effectively you onboard valuable individuals and projects, the greater your potential rewards. Key points include:

- **Early and Effective Onboarding**: Engage with high-potential members early to maximize your share of the revenue.
- **Network Growth**: As your referrals expand their networks and create Hubs, your share of the protocol revenue increases.
