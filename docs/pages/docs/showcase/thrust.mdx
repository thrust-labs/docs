## Explore Our Onchain Assets

To make your journey in Thrust Hub even more exciting, we’ve introduced a range of onchain assets. These assets are designed to showcase the power of Web3 and to provide you with tools to engage, earn, and interact within our growing community.

### **Stellie (STL)**

Meet **Stellie**, our ERC20 coin named after our friendly mascot. Stellie isn’t just a token; it’s a symbol of our community spirit. It’s fully tradable against USD stablecoins, making it easy for you to participate in the onchain economy within Thrust Hub. Whether you’re tipping a fellow member or trading on StellarSwap, Stellie keeps the community thriving.

### **Pixy Dust (PXD)**

**Pixy Dust** is pure magic—literally! **PXD** are soulbound points that can only be earned, not bought. They serve as tokens of appreciation, recognizing the valuable contributions of any community member. Anyone in the Hub can airdrop PXD to another member within their allowance, making it easy to show gratitude and encourage positive engagement. Got a message you think is top-notch? Tip it with PXD in just one click!

### **Gold Pass (GPAS)**

Unlock exclusive experiences with the **Gold Pass**. **GPAS** is a tradable passkey that grants you access to premium content within private spaces we call the **Alpha Lounge**. Whether you're looking to dive into insider discussions or access top-tier content, the Gold Pass is your ticket. Plus, you can trade GPAS directly inside the Hub on StellarSwap, making it both a powerful tool and a valuable asset.
